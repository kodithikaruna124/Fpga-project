Multipliers plays an important role in reducing the computational complexity of DSP 
algorithms and improve their efficiency. Efficient multipliers helps to reduce the processing 
time, area and minimize power consumption.Vedic mathematics has certain sets of formulae 
and rules which are simple and easy to perfom mathematical operation. There are 16 sutras 
and 13 upa sutras explained vedic mathematics. In this project, the squaring operation which 
is a special case of multiplication is designed using three vedic sutras â€“ Yavadunam, 
Nikhilam, Urdhava-Tirayakbhayam. The objective of this project is to develop a efficient 
squaring architecture using the algorithms of vedic sutras. The 3 different architecture are 
compared with array multiplier in terms of area, power and delay. The various architectures 
are modeled in verilog , functionally simulated in Modelsim software and implemented in 
Altera DE1 FPGA board. The squaring operation using Urdhava-Tirayakbhayam sutra has 
reduced time delay, power and area compared to array multiplier.
